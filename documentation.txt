Documentation Points:

Add axis, coordinate systems
Eplain for closed loop linkages, how to split and add fixed link (add fixed link using model edior in gazebo)
Create an sdf, urdf doesnot support closed loop linkages
Name links, add limits for revolute, vel, torque, upp, lower
Export and spawn in gazebo
For gears set kinetic tag to true, seems to work for now

04/05/21

Created base default_model.sdf, directly from SW, add fixed links and converted to sdf
-- Default model moves when force applied on joints 2468

Created model.sdf, added a box 10kg mass
-- By applying force all 4 legs move, but phase is not maintained

Created launch files 
-- default_model.launch, model.launch

Pushed all to main branch

Created test branch
-- To test next phases incl gear train and moveit

07/05
Cannot convert SDF to URDF format. The main reason to convert to sdf was the support of closed loop linkages
If reverted back to URDF then, most probably will lose the closed loop linkage

Try to simulate the motion without close loop, move independently the 4 legs, removing the gear constraint

Try to simulate the cube using SDF format, there has to be one, else the SDF is of no use

Problems
At first the spawn was not successful, the robot would spawn and fall immediately.
-- Noticed links were being copied, urdf does not understand close loop linkages.
To simulate a closed loop linkage, split a common link into two parts and add a fixed joint between them
Splitted the links on klann and leg to simulate, and added the fixed link using gazebo's model editor

The links were not repeated while spawning, but the bot would again fall immediately after spawning.
-- Set the kinematic tag to true for all gear linkages to hold the position of legs
The robot spawns perfectly.

By setting the kinematic tag to true, the joints dont move in gazebo.
-- To move the joints, launch in paused state, the default_model.sdf or model.sdf
By using the right side panel for forces, position and velocity, given 0.2 to front and 0.4 to back legs to move them
