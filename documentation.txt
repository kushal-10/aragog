Documentation Points:

Add axis, coordinate systems
Eplain for closed loop linkages, how to split and add fixed link (add fixed link using model edior in gazebo)
Create an sdf, urdf doesnot support closed loop linkages
Name links, add limits for revolute, vel, torque, upp, lower
Export and spawn in gazebo
For gears set kinetic tag to true, seems to work for now

Default model moves when force applied on joints 2468
Using kinematic tag the joints dont move, even when force is applied


Problems
1) At first the spawn was not successful, the robot would spawn and fall immediately.
--> Noticed links were being copied, urdf does not understand close loop linkages.
To simulate a closed loop linkage, split a common link into two parts and add a fixed joint between them
Splitted the links on klann and leg to simulate, and added the fixed link using gazebo's model editor

2) The links were not repeated while spawning, but the bot would again fall immediately after spawning.
--> Set the kinematic tag to true for all gear linkages to hold the position of legs
The robot spawns perfectly!!!!!!!!!
